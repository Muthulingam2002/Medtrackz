<!--             As the world responds to the Â COVID-19 pandemic,
we face the challenge of an overabundance of information 
Related to the virus. Some of this information may be false 
and potentially harmful.
            Inaccurate information spreads widely and at speed, 
making it more difficult for the public to identify verified facts
            So we have created a platform to provide verified facts
 and advices from trusted sources.
           And the users can also clarify their doubts with the health 
Care authorities.

<!--  
 we have used flutter for the UI
 firebase for the authentication

 cloud firestore for saving the data -->
